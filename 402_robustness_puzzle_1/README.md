# Robustness puzzle 1

This script tries to load a mesh and visualize it using `tsurf()`. 

Rather than loading from a standard mesh file format, it loads a list of vertices `V` and faces `F` directly from a file that I have saved. Loading directly from manually-written data happens, for instance, when you are transferring the data from some other tool.

However, the script won't work! Something is wrong with the mesh data. I promise these files are (almost) correct. Figure out what is wrong, and fix it.
